# Buck-Converter
I designed a PCB that is 12 VDC to 3.3 VDC, 1A Buck Converter in order to improve myself. In this design, I was careful about the reference plane and the noisy parts like the SW pin and the inductor. According to my research, if there is any, the orientation of the inductor is important because of the starting point of the inductor winding. Because if the starting point of the inductor is inside, the probability of creating noise is lower. Therefore, in order to reduce the noise in terms of EMI, the dot point of the inductor (the start of the winding of the inductor) should be close to the SW pin.
